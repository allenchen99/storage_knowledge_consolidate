# Journaling Modes Comparison Table

| **Journaling Mode**   | **Data Write Order**                               | **Performance**       | **Consistency**   | **Advantages**                                  | **Disadvantages**                             | **Use Cases**                                |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Journal Mode**       | Both data and metadata are written to the journal first, then to disk | **Worst** (high write latency, slower I/O) | **Strongest**      | Ensures maximum data consistency and recovery in case of failure | Performance is the slowest, higher write delay (e.g., 50-100ms per write) | High consistency and data recovery systems like **databases** or **financial systems** |
| **Ordered Mode**       | Data is written to disk first, then metadata is written to the journal | **Good** (moderate write latency, balanced I/O) | **Moderate**      | Balances performance and consistency, suitable for most applications | May lose some data (e.g., files partially written, but metadata is intact) | General file systems, everyday applications |
| **Writeback Mode**     | Metadata is written to the journal, data can be written in any order to disk | **Best** (low write latency, fast I/O) | **Weakest**       | Best performance, minimal impact on system response times (e.g., 10-20ms per write) | Data consistency is weak, may result in data loss or corruption in case of crash | High performance environments, **temporary files**, **caching**, or applications where data loss is tolerable |
